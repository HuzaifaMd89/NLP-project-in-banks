# NLP-project-in-bank.

📌 Project Overview

This project automates the classification of customer complaints in the banking sector using Supervised Machine Learning and a Neural Network (Keras). The system categorizes complaints into five predefined classes:

Accounts

Fraud

Bank-Related Services

Loans

Other

By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and advanced classification models, this system enhances customer support efficiency and response times.

🔍 Problem Statement

Banks receive thousands of customer complaints daily, making manual classification inefficient. This project addresses the problem by building a model that automatically classifies complaints based on their content, allowing banks to route them to the appropriate departments.

🚀 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks

Deep Learning Framework: Keras (TensorFlow backend)

Natural Language Processing (NLP): TF-IDF, Word Embeddings

Dataset: Customer complaints dataset (preprocessed textual data)
